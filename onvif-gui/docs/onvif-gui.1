.SH SEE ALSO 

There is a command line version of this program included with the libonvif package which will implement most of the same commands. It may be invoked using the 'onvif-util' command.
.SH NOTES

Camera compliance with the onvif standard is often incomplete and in some cases incorrect. Success with the onvif-util may be limited in many cases. Cameras made by Hikvision will have the greatest level of compatibility with onvif-util. Cameras made by Dahua will have a close degree of compatability with some notable exceptions regarding gateway and DNS settings. Time settings may not be reliable in some cases. If the time is set without the zone flag, the time appearing in the camera feed will be synced to the computer time. If the time zone flag is used, the displayed time may be set to an offset from the computer time based on the timezone setting of the camera.
.PP
If the camera DNS setting is properly onvif compliant, the IP address may be reliably set. Some cameras may not respond to the DNS setting requested by \fBonvif-gui\fP due to non compliance. Note that the camera may reboot automatically under some conditions if the DNS setting is changed from off to on.
